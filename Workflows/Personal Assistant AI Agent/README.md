# 🧠 Personal Assistant Agents Suite

This repository contains a suite of **AI-powered agents** built using **n8n** and **LangChain** for workflow automation. It was developed as part of my **Workflow Automation Using n8n and AI Agents Internship**.

The primary goal of this project was to **design and implement a complex workflow** that integrates multiple AI agents, enabling them to collaborate and automate real-world tasks like email management, calendar scheduling, project tracking, and information retrieval.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

As part of my internship, I was tasked with building a **complex, multi-agent workflow** to demonstrate:

* Natural language understanding for dynamic user commands.
* Orchestration of multiple tools and APIs within n8n.
* Error handling and graceful fallback mechanisms.

This project leverages **n8n**, **LangChain**, **OpenAI GPT models**, and several external APIs to deliver a fully functional **Personal Assistant** system.

## 📥 Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install **n8n** locally or on a server.
3. Import the workflow JSON files into n8n:

   * `Calendar_Agent.json`
   * `Email_Agent.json`
   * `Personal_Assistant.json`
   * `Projects_Agent.json`
   * `Research_Agent.json`
4. Set up API credentials as described in [Configuration](#configuration).

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

* **Google APIs**: OAuth2 credentials for Google Calendar, Gmail, and Google Sheets.
* **OpenAI API**: Access to GPT-4o or GPT-3.5 models.
* **SerpAPI**: For Google search queries.
* **Telegram API**: To interact with the Personal Assistant via Telegram.

Configure credentials within n8n’s credentials manager.
